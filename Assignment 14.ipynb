    "RGBA stands for Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha. It is a color model that includes an additional alpha channel representing the transparency or opacity of a pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans2.\n",
    "In the Pillow module (PIL), you can get the RGBA value of any image by using the `getpixel()` method. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from PIL import Image\n",
    "\n",
    "image = Image.open(\"example.jpg\")\n",
    "rgba_value = image.getpixel((x, y))  # Replace x and y with the coordinates of the pixel\n",
    "print(rgba_value)  # Output: (R, G, B, A) where R, G, B, and A are integer values representing the color channels.\n",

    "#### Ans3.\n",
    "A box tuple is a tuple representing a rectangular region within an image. It is used in various Pillow methods to define a specific region of interest within the image. The box tuple is defined as `(left, upper, right, lower)`, where:\n",
    "   - `left`: The x-coordinate of the leftmost pixel of the box.\n",
    "   - `upper`: The y-coordinate of the uppermost pixel of the box.\n",
    "   - `right`: The x-coordinate of the rightmost pixel of the box.\n",
    "   - `lower`: The y-coordinate of the lowermost pixel of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans4.\n",
    "To find out the width and height of an Image object, you can use the `size` attribute of the Image object:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from PIL import Image\n",
    "\n",
    "image = Image.open(\"example.jpg\")\n",
    "width, height = image.size\n",
    "print(\"Width:\", width)\n",
    "print(\"Height:\", height)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans5.\n",
    "To get an Image object for a 100Ã—100 image, excluding the lower-left quarter of it, you can use the `crop()` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from PIL import Image\n",
    "\n",
    "image = Image.open(\"example.jpg\")\n",
    "width, height = image.size\n",
    "upper_left = (0, 0)\n",
    "lower_right = (width // 2, height // 2)\n",

    "cropped_image.show()\n",

    "#### Ans6.\n",
    "After making changes to an Image object, you can save it as an image file using the `save()` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from PIL import Image\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open the image and make changes\n",
    "image = Image.open(\"example.jpg\")\n",
    "# ...\n",
    "\n",
    "# Save the modified image\n",
    "image.save(\"modified_example.jpg\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans7.\n",
    "The module that contains Pillow's shape-drawing code is `PIL.ImageDraw`. It provides various methods to draw shapes like lines, rectangles, ellipses, and more on the Image object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans8.\n",
    "Image objects do not have built-in drawing methods. Instead, drawing operations are performed using the `ImageDraw` module from Pillow. You can create an `ImageDraw` object, draw shapes on it, and then paste the modified `ImageDraw` object back onto the original Image object."
