    "#### Ans1) Difference between enclosing a list comprehension in square brackets and parentheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Square brackets `[]`: When you enclose a list comprehension in square brackets, it creates a new list containing the results of the comprehension. The entire list is constructed and stored in memory at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "squares_list = [x**2 for x in range(5)]\n",
    "# squares_list will be [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parentheses `()`: When you enclose a list comprehension in parentheses, it creates a generator expression. A generator expression generates values on-the-fly as they are needed. The elements are not stored in memory all at once, making it memory-efficient, especially for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "squares_generator = (x**2 for x in range(5))\n",
    "# squares_generator will be a generator object\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans2) Relationship between generators and iterators:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generators are a type of iterators. An iterator is an object that implements two methods: `__iter__()` and `__next__()`. Generators are a specific type of iterator that can be created using generator functions or generator expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The key difference between a regular iterator and a generator is that generators use the `yield` statement to produce values one at a time, while iterators typically use a `__next__()` method to produce the next value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans3) Signs that a function is a generator function:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A generator function is defined using the `def` keyword, like a regular function.\n",
    "- Inside the generator function, instead of using `return` to return a value, it uses the `yield` statement to yield a value.\n",
    "- When calling a generator function, it does not execute the function body immediately. Instead, it returns a generator object that can be iterated over to produce values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a generator function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def countdown(n):\n",
    "    while n > 0:\n",
    "        yield n\n",
    "        n -= 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans4) Purpose of a yield statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `yield` statement in a generator function is used to produce a value and suspend the function's state temporarily. When the generator function is called again, it resumes execution from the point of the last `yield` statement, retaining its local variables' state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `yield` statement allows generators to produce values lazily and efficiently, generating values on-the-fly when needed. This makes generators memory-efficient, especially for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans5) Relationship between map calls and list comprehensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Both `map()` calls and list comprehensions are used to apply a function to every element of an iterable (e.g., list, tuple) and return a new iterable containing the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `map()` function: It takes a function and an iterable as arguments and applies the function to each element of the iterable. It returns an iterator, so to get a list, you need to wrap it with `list()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result_map = map(lambda x: x**2, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
    "# result_map is an iterator object\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- List comprehensions: They create a new list by applying an expression to each element of an iterable and collecting the results in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result_list_comp = [x**2 for x in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]\n",
    "# result_list_comp will be [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison and contrast:\n",
    "- `map()` returns an iterator, while list comprehensions return a list.\n",
    "- List comprehensions are generally more readable and easier to write compared to `map()`.\n",
    "- List comprehensions support more complex expressions and conditions, making them more versatile in certain situations.\n",
    "- `map()` can be more memory-efficient when working with large datasets since it returns an iterator, whereas list comprehensions create the entire list in memory. However, when memory is not a concern, list comprehensions are often preferred due to their simplicity and readability."
