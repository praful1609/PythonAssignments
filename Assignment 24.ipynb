    "Relationship between def statements and lambda expressions:\n",
    "Both `def` statements and `lambda` expressions are used to create functions in Python, but they differ in their syntax and usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `def` statement: It is used to define named functions with a block of code. Functions defined using `def` can have multiple lines of code, and they can have a name assigned to them, making them reusable throughout the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(x, y):\n",
    "    return x + y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `lambda` expression: It is used to create anonymous functions, also known as lambda functions. Lambda functions are simple, one-line functions that can take any number of arguments but can only have a single expression. Lambda functions are often used for small, simple tasks and are commonly used with higher-order functions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "add = lambda x, y: x + y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans2.\n",
    "Benefits of lambda:\n",
    "Lambda functions have several benefits:\n",
    "- Concise syntax: Lambda expressions allow you to define small, one-liner functions without needing to give them a formal name.\n",
    "- Short-lived functions: They are useful for small tasks where you need a function temporarily and don't want to define a full-fledged named function using `def`.\n",
    "- Used with higher-order functions: Lambda functions are often used with functions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` to apply a simple operation on iterable elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Compare and contrast map, filter, and reduce:\n",
    "- `map`: The `map` function applies a given function to each item of an iterable (e.g., list, tuple) and returns a new iterable containing the results. The new iterable will have the same length as the original iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `filter`: The `filter` function filters elements from an iterable based on a given function that returns a Boolean value. It returns an iterable containing only the elements for which the function returns `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `reduce`: The `reduce` function (not available in the built-in namespace directly) from the `functools` module applies a binary function to the elements of an iterable in a cumulative way to reduce it to a single value. It's commonly used to perform operations like cumulative sum or product.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans4.\n",
    "Function annotations:\n",
    "Function annotations in Python allow you to add arbitrary metadata to the parameters and return value of a function. They are optional and are defined using colons and expressions following the function arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:\n",
    "    return x + y\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, `int` is a function annotation for the parameters `x` and `y`, indicating that the function expects integer arguments, and `-> int` indicates that the function returns an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans5.\n",
    "Recursive functions:\n",
    "A recursive function is a function that calls itself during its execution. It is a common programming technique used when a problem can be divided into smaller sub-problems of the same nature. Recursive functions have a base case to terminate the recursion and avoid infinite loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def factorial(n):\n",
    "    if n == 0:\n",
    "        return 1\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return n * factorial(n-1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans6.\n",
    "General design guidelines for coding functions:\n",
    "- Functions should have descriptive names that indicate their purpose.\n",
    "- Keep functions short and focused on performing a specific task.\n",
    "- Use function annotations and docstrings to provide clear information about function arguments and return values.\n",
    "- Avoid using global variables inside functions; instead, pass required data as arguments.\n",
    "- Avoid side effects in functions, and try to make them pure functions (functions that produce the same output for the same input).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans7.\n",
    "Ways functions can communicate results to a caller:\n",
    "- Return statement: Functions can communicate results back to the caller using the `return` statement, where a value or multiple values can be returned.\n",
    "- Print statement: Functions can use the `print` statement to display intermediate results, but it doesn't communicate the result back to the caller.\n",
    "- Modifying mutable objects: Functions can modify mutable objects (like lists or dictionaries) passed as arguments, which will be visible to the caller after the function call.\n",
    "- Function annotations: Function annotations can provide additional information to the caller about the expected types of arguments and return values, even though they don't directly communicate the results."
