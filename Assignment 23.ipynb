    "What is the result of the code, and why?\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> def func(a, b=6, c=8):\n",

    "Result:\n",
    "```\n",
    "1 2 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "In this code, the function `func()` is defined with three parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`. The default values for `b` and `c` are `6` and `8`, respectively. When we call `func(1, 2)`, the value of `a` is set to `1`, `b` is set to `2`, and `c` retains its default value of `8`.\n",

    "What is the result of this code, and why?\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> def func(a, b, c=5):\n",
    "...     print(a, b, c)\n",

    "1 2 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "In this code, the function `func()` is defined with three parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`. The default value for `c` is `5`. When we call `func(1, c=3, b=2)`, the value of `a` is set to `1`, `b` is set to `2`, and `c` is explicitly set to `3` using keyword argument `c=3`, overriding its default value of `5`.\n",

    "How about this code: what is its result, and why?\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> def func(a, *pargs):\n",
    "...     print(a, pargs)\n",
    ">>> func(1, 2, 3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Result:\n",
    "```\n",
    "1 (2, 3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "In this code, the function `func()` is defined with a parameter `a` and `*pargs`, which is used to accept any number of additional positional arguments as a tuple. When we call `func(1, 2, 3)`, the value of `a` is set to `1`, and the tuple `pargs` contains the additional arguments `(2, 3)`.\n",

    "What does this code print, and why?\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> def func(a, **kargs):\n",
    "...     print(a, kargs)\n",

    "```\n",
    "1 {'c': 3, 'b': 2}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "In this code, the function `func()` is defined with a parameter `a` and `**kargs`, which is used to accept any number of additional keyword arguments as a dictionary. When we call `func(a=1, c=3, b=2)`, the value of `a` is set to `1`, and the dictionary `kargs` contains the additional keyword arguments `{'c': 3, 'b': 2}`.\n",

    "#### Ans5.\n",
    "What gets printed by this, and explain?\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> def func(a, b, c=8, d=5):\n",
    "...     print(a, b, c, d)\n",
    ">>> func(1, *(5, 6))\n",
    "```\n",
    "Result:\n",
    "```\n",
    "1 5 6 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "In this code, the function `func()` is defined with four parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The default values for `c` and `d` are `8` and `5`, respectively. When we call `func(1, *(5, 6))`, the `*` operator is used to unpack the tuple `(5, 6)`, and its elements are passed as additional positional arguments to the function. So, `a` is set to `1`, `b` is set to `5`, and `c` and `d` retain their default values `6` and `5`, respectively.\n",

    "#### Ans6.\n",
    "What is the result of this, and explain?\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> def func(a, b, c):\n",
    "...     a = 2\n",
    "...     b[0] = 'x'\n",
    "...     c['a'] = 'y'\n",
    ">>> l = 1\n",
    ">>> m = [1]\n",
    ">>> n = {'a': 0}\n",
    ">>> func(l, m, n)\n",
    ">>> l, m, n\n",
    "```\n",
    "Result:\n",
    "```\n",
    "(1, ['x'], {'a': 'y'})\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "In this code, the function `func()` takes three arguments `a`, `b`, and `c`. Inside the function, `a` is assigned the value `2`, `b[0]` is modified to `'x'`, and `c['a']` is modified to `'y'`. \n",
    "\n",
    "After calling `func(l, m, n)`, the values of the variables `l`, `m`, and `n` are printed. `l` remains unchanged as `1`, `m` is modified to `['x']`, and `n` is modified to `{'a': 'y'}`. This behavior is due"
