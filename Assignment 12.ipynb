    "The `PdfFileReader()` and `PdfFileWriter()` File objects should be opened in binary mode ('rb') when working with PDF files.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans2.\n",
    "To get a Page object for page 5 from a `PdfFileReader` object (let's say `pdf_reader`), you can use the `getPage()` method, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "page_number = 5  # Page numbers are 0-indexed\n",
    "page = pdf_reader.getPage(page_number)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans3.\n",
    "The `PdfFileReader` variable that stores the number of pages in the PDF document is `numPages`. You can access it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "num_pages = pdf_reader.numPages\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans4.\n",
    "If a `PdfFileReader` object's PDF is encrypted with the password 'swordfish', you must use the `decrypt()` method and pass the correct password before obtaining Page objects. Here's how you would do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pdf_reader.decrypt('swordfish')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans5.\n",
    "To rotate a page, you can use the `rotateClockwise()` and `rotateCounterClockwise()` methods of the `Page` object. For example, to rotate the page 90 degrees clockwise, you can do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "page.rotateClockwise(90)\n",
    "```\n",

    "In the context of working with python-docx library (for Word documents):\n",
    "   - A `Run` object represents a contiguous run of text with the same character style in a paragraph.\n",
    "   - A `Paragraph` object represents a single paragraph of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans7.\n",
    "To obtain a list of `Paragraph` objects for a `Document` object stored in a variable named `doc`, you can use the `paragraphs` attribute of the `Document` object. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "paragraphs_list = doc.paragraphs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans8.\n",
    "The type of object that has bold, underline, italic, strike, and outline variables is the `Run` object. A `Run` object represents a contiguous run of text with the same character style within a paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans9.\n",
    "For the `bold` variable in a `Run` object:\n",
    "   - `True`: The text in the run is formatted as bold.\n",
    "   - `False`: The text in the run is not bold.\n",
    "   - `None`: The text in the run may have a mix of bold and non-bold formatting or inherits its bold formatting from the paragraph or document style.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans10.\n",
    "To create a `Document` object for a new Word document, you need to import the `Document` class from the python-docx library and create a new instance of it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from docx import Document\n",
    "\n",
    "doc = Document()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans11.\n",
    "To add a paragraph with the text 'Hello, there!' to a `Document` object stored in a variable named `doc`, you can use the `add_paragraph()` method of the `Document` object:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "doc.add_paragraph('Hello, there!')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "12. In Word documents, the integers representing the levels of headings are usually from 1 to 9. Heading level 1 is the highest level of heading, while heading level 9 is the lowest and has the least prominent formatting."
